# Cryptography

A Java package which currently contains only one library: the `uk.org.bobulous.java.crypto.keccak` package which provides an implementation of the [Keccak sponge function family of hash functions](http://keccak.noekeon.org/index.html), and the standardised SHA-3 instances (both SHA3 hash functions and SHAKE extendable-output functions).

## WARNING

**This project should be considered to be in beta.**

I've been working on this Java package for the last six weeks, and the code has been extensively tested in development, so I believe it's finally ready for other people to play with. However, there are bound to be errors, oversights, misunderstandings, and sneaky traps, so the advice is simple: do not use this package for important purposes without applying your own rigorous testing. Please raise an issue here on GitHub if you find any bugs.

## Features

This implementation supports the following features:

* All of the SHA-3 functions defined in [NIST FIPS PUB 202](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.202.pdf).
* Any Keccak sponge configuration with a width from 200 to 1600 (inclusive), and a bitrate which is exactly divisible by eight.
* Arbitrary output hash lengths.
* Arbitrary input message lengths when using byte array message input.
* Arbitrary whole-byte input message lengths when using `InputStream` message input.
* Input can be provided as a byte array or as an `InputStream`. Output is provided as a byte array, which will be padded with zero bits if the output length (in bits) is not exactly divisible by eight.
* The "lane complementing transform" optimisation (suggested by the Keccak team in their implementation guide). This is enabled with a hard switch in the `KeccakState` class, but can be disabled if it harms rather than benefits performance. (On my desktop machine I see a 22% reduction in runtime with this optimisation enabled, but other platforms may differ. This package has been primarily written on the assumption that 64-bit machines will be using it.)

## Performance

On my desktop (Intel Core i5-4460 3.20GHz desktop, running Java OpenJDK 1.8.0_131 on Kubuntu 16.04 on 64-bit Linux 4.4.0-78) the Kecack implementation in this package correctly completes each of the ExtremelyLongMsg known-answer tests in the following times:

Sponge function|Message size|Time taken|Throughput
-|-|-|-
SHA3-224|1GiB|16,500ms|520.60 Mbit/s
SHA3-256|1GiB|17,290ms|496.82 Mbit/s
SHA3-384|1GiB|21,647ms|396.82 Mbit/s
SHA3-512|1GiB|31,007ms|277.03 Mbit/s

The ExtremelyLongMsgKAT mandates the repetition of a byte sequence to give a total input message length of 1,073,741,824 bytes (1GiB). This sequence has been used to create an `InputStream` which is fed to the `apply(InputStream)` method of the corresponding `FIPS202.HashFunction` type. Consequently no disk access was involved, as the message is generated on-the-fly and fed to the Keccak sponge in blocks. So the numbers in the above table ought to represent maximum raw processing throughput.

Be aware that if raw hashing performance is critical to your application then you will get considerably higher performance if you're able to use the optimized C/C++ [KeccakCodePackage](https://github.com/gvanas/KeccakCodePackage) created by the Keccak team. And you're likely to get vastly higher performance if you use a dedicated hardware implementation of the Keccak function.

## Examples of use

Using the SHA-3 functions is made very simple by the `uk.org.bobulous.java.crypto.keccak.FIPS202` utility class. This utility class contains a `HashFunction` class which offers the SHA3 hash functions SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512, and an `ExtendableOutputFunction` class which holds definitions for the SHAKE extendable-output functions SHAKE128, SHAKE256, RawSHAKE128, and RawSHAKE256.

### SHA3 hash functions

Suppose you want to calculate the SHA3-256 hash for an empty `String` (and thus a message of length zero bits). You can do so like this:

```java
byte[] messageBytes = "".getBytes();
byte[] hashBytes = FIPS202.HashFunction.SHA3_256.apply(messageBytes);
String hashHex = FIPS202.hexFromBytes(hashBytes);
System.out.println(hashHex);
```

After running the above code you'll see on the console this hexadecimal representation of the SHA3-256 hash result:

> A7FFC6F8BF1ED76651C14756A061D662F580FF4DE43B49FA82D80A4B80F8434A

Note that the `FIPS202` class utility method `hexFromBytes(byte[])` is purely there for convenience, allowing you to convert a byte array hash result to a hex `String` for easy use where a `String` is most suitable. The byte array generated by the `apply` method is itself the hash result, and it is not necessary to call `hexFromBytes(byte[])` unless you want the result as a `String` for some purpose.

If you wanted something a bit more useful, you could calculate the SHA3-512 hash of a non-empty message with the following (remembering that the character encoding used to convert the `String` into bytes is a critically important factor):

```java
byte[] messageBytes = messageBody.getBytes(Charset.forName("UTF-8"));
byte[] hashBytes = FIPS202.HashFunction.SHA3_512.apply(messageBytes);
```

### SHAKE extendable-output functions

Each SHAKE extendable-output function (XOF) requires that you choose an output length for the generated hash. You can create a reusable `KeccakSponge` object which represents your chosen XOF with your chosen output length, and then apply it to our empty message like this:

```java
byte[] messageBytes = new byte[] {};
KeccakSponge sponge = FIPS202.ExtendableOutputFunction.SHAKE256.withOutputLength(4096);
byte[] hashBytes = sponge.apply(messageBytes);
```

### Defining a custom Keccak sponge function

If you're sure you know what you're doing and you want to create a Keccak sponge function with custom parameters then you can do so using the `KeccakSponge` constructor `KeccakSponge(int bitrate, int capacity, String domainSuffix, int outputLength)`, and then apply it to our empty message like this:

```java
KeccakSponge spongeFunction = new KeccakSponge(40, 160, "", 4096);
byte[] message = new byte[]{};
byte[] hash = spongeFunction.apply(5, message);
```

The created `KeccakSponge` object is immutable and re-usable, and is safe to share.

### Applying the hash functions to an `InputStream`

The hash functions are all able to read from an `InputStream` instead of a byte array, which should be more convenient if you're trying to hash the content of files. For example, suppose you want to calculate the SHA3-512 hash for a file called "AOL-data.tgz" in your home directory:

```java
File oopsData = new File("/home/bob/AOL-data.tgz");
InputStream fileStream = new FileInputStream(oopsData);
byte[] fileHash = FIPS202.HashFunction.SHA3_512.apply(fileStream);
```

(Though bear in mind that the `apply(InputStream)` method signature declares that it `throws IOException` in case anything goes wrong while working with the `InputStream`.)

## More to do

I intend to implement further optimisations to the Keccak permutation code.
